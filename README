This code perform force matching procedure [1] to obtain AMBER force field parameters 
for QM atoms in an QM/MM simulation.
I wrote this code to fit the data generated by QM/MM simulations.
The results were published in this research paper [2].

It reads outputs from a QM/MM simulation using the CPMD code (http://www.cpmd.org) including MD trajectory, 
forces acting on each of QM atoms and a series of electrostatic grids along the trajectory.
Then it performs least squares fitting to obtain both non-bonded and bonded parameters for QM atoms.
See the references for more details.

It runs iteractively. See Example directory for example input files.
